# Machine Learning 

The aim of this repository is to implement from scratch, using only numpy and python most basic libraries, classical machine learning algorithms.
We will go through the following algorithms : 

### Logistic Regression

In the repository `logistic_regression/` you will find a python script `LogisticRegression` that defines a class which can be used to create binary logistic regression classification models. Comes along a python notebook that tests the model on the *diabetes dataset*. </br>

### Linear Regression

The repository `linear_regression/` presents a python class `LinearRegression` which can be used to create multi-linear regression models. </br>

### Linear Regression Regularized

Work in progress ðŸš§ </br>

### Linear Discrimimant Analysis

The repository `lda/` presents a python class `LDA` which can be used to create multi-class classification models. We aim to imrove this repository to later be able to use linear discriminant analysis for dimension reduction.</br>

### Multi Layer Perceptron

Work in progress ðŸš§ </br>

### Quadratic Dicriminant Analysis

Work in progress ðŸš§ </br>
