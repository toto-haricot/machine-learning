# Machine Learning 

The aim of this repository is to implement from scratch, using only numpy and python most basic libraries, classical machine learning algorithms.
We will go through the following algorithms : 

### Logistic Regression

In the repository `logistic_regression/` you will find a python script `LogisticRegression` that defines a class which can be used to create binary logistic regression classification models. Comes along a python notebook that tests the model on the *diabetes dataset*. </br>

### Linear Regression

The repository `linear_regression/` presents a python class `LinearRegression` which can be used to create multi-linear regression models. </br>

### Linear Regression Regularized

### Linear Discrimimant Analysis

### Multi Layer Perceptron

### Quadratic Dicriminant Analysis
